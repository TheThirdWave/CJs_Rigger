So there are some things you gotta do after the rig has been generated to get it working properly, this is just a
very rough running list of the things that I can think of:

-For the mouth, you have to skin the jaw so you get good deformation when the mouth is open, then copy
 the blendshape weights to the "dense" curves in the jaw component (in order to do THAT, you have to first
 attach a skincluster to each curve that has the same influences as the skincluster for the jaw/mouth blendshape)
 You should only have to do this once, because the dense curves should save out their weights with everything else
 when you click the "save skin data" button and after that the "Bind Skin" button should generate the skincluster
 just like it would for the skinned meshes.
 
 Only after you set up the curve weights should you start skinning the individual lip joints, so the process goes like:

 Skin the jaw joint to the mesh -> copy the mesh weights to the dense curves in the moth component -> save out weights -> skin the rest of the mouth joints

-Also for the mouth component, there's a proximityWrap node attached to the "upper_DEF_RBN" NURBS ribbon, you'll probably have to adjust the parameters of that
 to get better deformations.

-Anything with an IKFKSpline component you might want to adjust the squash/stretch parameters for each joint so it looks right.
-Ditto, I think, for the IKFKLimb component.
